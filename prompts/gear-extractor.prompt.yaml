         - Full product name
         - Brand/manufacturer

         - Category (backpack, tent, sleeping_bag, sleeping_pad, clothing, footwear, cookware, water_filtration, navigation, lighting, trekking_poles, accessories, first_aid, other)
         - Weight in grams (convert if given in other units)
         - Price in USD (convert if given in other currencies)
         - Materials used
         - Key features

         - Usage tips and recommendations
         - Warnings or potential issues
         - Comparisons between products
         - Real-world experience reports

      Guidelines:

      - Convert all weights to grams and prices to USD
      - Assign confidence scores (0.0-1.0) based on how clearly the information was stated
      - Include the source URL for all facts
